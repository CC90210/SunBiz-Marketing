SunBiz Funding - AI Ad Copy Generator
=======================================
Generates MCA-compliant ad copy for SunBiz Funding campaigns.

Primary path:  Gemini API (via GEMINI_API_KEY in .env.agents) — generative copy.
Fallback path: Built-in template banks — no API key required, always works.

Compliance rules enforced on ALL output:
  - Forbidden: "loan", "MCA", "merchant cash advance", "guaranteed approval",
               "hard credit pull", "guarantee", "guaranteed"
  - Required CTAs: "See if you qualify", "Apply now", "Check your options"
  - Amounts always preceded by "up to"
  - No unlicensed claims about approval rates or timelines

Campaign types:
  growth_capital, consolidation, fast_funding, industry, social_proof

Usage:
    from scripts.ad_copy_generator import AdCopyGenerator

    gen = AdCopyGenerator()
    copy = gen.generate_ad_copy("growth_capital", tone="confident", num_variations=3)
    print(gen.validate_compliance(copy[0]["headline"]))
