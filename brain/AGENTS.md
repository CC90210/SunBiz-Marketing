## Dispatch Rules

1. **Always route to the most specific agent** — Don't use architect for ad copy
2. **Chain agents for multi-step tasks** — Output of one feeds input of next
3. **Parallel execution when independent** — Google and Meta operations can run simultaneously
4. **Escalate to Opus for ambiguity** — When task is unclear, use ad-strategist (Opus) to interpret
5. **Log all agent dispatches** — Track which agents handled which tasks for pattern learning
