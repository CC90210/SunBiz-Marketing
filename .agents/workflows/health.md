# /health — System Health Diagnostic

## When to Use
Use `/health` at session start, when something seems off, or for routine checks.

## Steps

1. **API Connectivity** — Test Google Ads (list campaigns) + Meta Ads (read account).

2. **Token Validity** — Google OAuth2 refresh token valid? Meta access token valid/expiry? Developer token active?

3. **MCP Servers** — All 6+ servers responding? (Google Ads, Meta Ads, Playwright, Context7, Memory, Sequential Thinking)

4. **Campaign Health:**
   - Any rejected ads? → Surface reason + fix
   - Stuck in Learning >7 days? → Check conversions
   - $0 spend today? → Investigate delivery
   - CPL >2x target? → Flag for optimization
   - CTR <0.5%? → Flag for creative refresh

5. **Compliance** — All Meta lending ads have CREDIT category? No restricted targeting? Disclosures present?

6. **Infrastructure** — `.env.agents` complete? Python packages installed? Wrapper scripts present? Git clean?

7. **Report:**
   ```
